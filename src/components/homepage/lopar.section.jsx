          nearness to Rijeka and its airport. This especially attractive drive
          lasts approximately 90 minutes. Coming by car from direction of Rab
          first thing we see is a sign which reminds us of St.Marin,
          stone-cutter and founder of republic of San Marino, who was born in
          Lopar in the 4th century. In his honor, hotel settlement and motor
          camp bear name "San Marino".
